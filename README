================================================================================
  XmCollParser - A parser for the XMMS2 collection query language.
================================================================================

This parser is a complete rewrite of the collection parser from the xmmsclient
library, written with Bison and Flex. At the exception of the test program, the
compiled library depends on the xmmsclient library only.



Compilation and installation
============================

Requirements
------------

  - The xmmsclient library
  - Bison and Flex (required only if you want to patch .y or .l files.)
  - python 2.5+ (for the WAF build system)

Compilation
-----------

  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf build

Installation
------------

  $ ./waf install



Differences with the original collection parser
===============================================

  - Supports shell-like in-string quotes:
      foo:He'll'o" World"!
    is equivalent to
      foo:"Hello World!"

  - A sequence of ids generate an idlist without repeated ids:
      #1,5,3-6
    is converted to  IdList: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)

  - Quoted '*' and '?' are considered literal characters when used with the ':'
    filter operator:
      e.g.   foo:"Hello*World"
    However, they can't be mixed with non-quoted */? (see Issues section below).
