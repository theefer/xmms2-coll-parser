================================================================================
  XmCollParser - A parser for the XMMS2 collection query language.
================================================================================

This parser is a complete rewrite of the collection parser from the xmmsclient
library, written with Bison and Flex. At the exception of the test program, the
compiled library depends on the xmmsclient library only.



Compilation and installation
============================

Requirements
------------

  - The xmmsclient library
  - Bison and Flex (required only if you want to patch .y or .l files.)
  - python 2.5+ (for the WAF build system)

Compilation
-----------

  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf build

Installation
------------

  $ ./waf install



Differences with the original collection parser
===============================================

  - Supports shell-like in-string quotes:
      foo:He'll'o" World"!
    is equivalent to
      foo:"Hello World!"

  - A sequence of ids generate an idlist without repeated ids:
      #1,5,3-6
    is converted to  IdList: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)

  - Quoted '*' and '?' are considered literal characters when used with the ':'
    filter operator:
      e.g.   foo:"Hello*World"
    However, they can't be mixed with non-quoted */? (see Issues section below).


Issues
======

At this stage, collection structures produced by the parser have not been tested
for real queries. Suspected issues are the following:

  - A combination of quoted and non-quoted * and ?, makes all * and ?
    glob characters.
      e.g.   foo:'foo*bar'?   is equivalent to   foo~foo*bar?
    The behavior of quoted */? might change in the future to match the behavior
    of the original parser, except if support for literal */? in MATCH patterns
    is added in XMMS2.

  - * alone does not match Universe
